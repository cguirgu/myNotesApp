# myNotesApp
This is a basic notes application I created while following along with a Udemy course about Node.js.

In this app, you can add a note, remove a note, list out your notes, and read a note from your command line. All note data is saved in the notes.json file.

The practice folder contains random concepts/techniques I learned and practiced as I was creating the Notes App.
